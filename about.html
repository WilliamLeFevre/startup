                Trivia Survival is a game for answering questions and building a high score, and seeing how you compare with other users. You are continuously fed trivia questions, 
                one after another, and as soon as you miss one, your game ends and you are placed on the leaderboard according to your score. 
                To help you score high, you are equipped with 3 skips, that lets you avoid answering a question you 
                don't know. Make sure you answer quickly, because each question has you on a time limit, and if you don't
                 answer in time, you lose!
